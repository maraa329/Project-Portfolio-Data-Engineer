## SQL Practice Exercises

This folder contains my practice exercises while learning SQL fundamentals in MySQL.  
Each file demonstrates how to use a specific SQL concept or feature, with examples I coded and tested.  

### Topics Covered
- **Basic Queries**: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `LIMIT`, `ALIASING`
- **Filtering**: `HAVING vs. WHERE`, `Logical Operators`, `LIKE`
- **Aggregations**: `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- **Joins**: Inner, Left, Right, and Full Joins
- **Advanced Queries**: `Subqueries`, `Window Functions`, `CTEs`
- **Data Manipulation**: `CASE Statements`, `String Functions`
- **Database Structures**: `Temporary Tables`, `Stored Procedures`, `Triggers`, `Events`
- **Set Operations**: `UNION`

### Purpose
The goal of these exercises was to strengthen my understanding of SQL by writing queries from scratch, practicing data filtering and grouping, and exploring advanced features like window functions, CTEs, and stored procedures. This practice built the foundation for my larger projects (Data Cleaning and EDA).
